      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>1 in 3 young adults have a mental illness - and the average American spends over 7 hours looking at the phone each day. Are they related? That’s a topic for later, but what if some of those hours on the screen were spent bettering mental health? With this website, individuals of any age will be able to create a safe place to express themselves, have access to helpful and supportive resources, and develop healthy habits to live to their fullest potential. Let’s make the world a better place starting with one person at a time. 
    </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>I want my audience to be anyone at any age, because mental health affects everyone. I want my website to be usable for young people and old people by having simple commands, bright colors, and fun infographics. I want my website to help those who are struggling with mental health issues and those who are not, the website is designed to help people enjoy their lives and develop healthy habits. </p>  <!-- change this -->

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        **THE GOAL**
      </h3>
      <p>
        For this website, I want to create a safe and easy way for individuals to learn about mental health. Mental health is such an important topic that still is <br>
        taboo in our society and I want to break that stimga. I want this website to have fun and creative ways to help people become their best selves and to enjoy life!
        </br>
      </p>
      <h3>
        **EXAMPLE OF CONTENT**
      </h3>
      <p class="colored">
        Some of the content that I want in my website is articles about different health topics, personality quizzes, infographics, a list of avaible hotlines, <br>
      a place where they can journal, a meal planner, a habit tracker, food recipes, and other things along this line. Content like this will help others form <br>
      good habits learn new things.
